# What is Java?

1. General Purpose
    ```md
    Java can be used to create a wide variety of application domains. It can be applied to cyber-security, machine-learning, web-development, enterprise and desktop apps.
    ```

2. Object Oriented.
    ```md
    Meaning that it uses the concept of classes and objects. In other
    words blueprints an instances of those blueprints. Kind of emulating
    real life.
    ```
3. Platform Independent.
    ```md
    Write Once Run Anywhere. (WORA).
    Code written in Java is meant to be able to execute on any platform regardless of operating system or architecture.
    ```
4. Concurrent.
    ```md
    Java programming allows for multi-threading meaning that it allows a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time.
    ```
5. Very fast.
    ```md
    Almost indistinguishable from C and C++ in terms of some of Java has
    to be compiled to machine language that makes it run fast.
    ```

Other features of the Java include.

* Familiar syntax:
    ```md
    For C and C++ engineers to make it easier for most programmers in the 1990s to transition to Java.
    ```
* Simplicity and Safety:
    ```md
    Compared to C & C++ where you have to manage/manipulate memory yourself to free space up.

    Java has automatic memory management that deals with that.
    ```

* Security:
    ```md
    Java compiler converts the Java code into byte code (.class files) and these byte codes are then run by Java Virtual Machine(JVM).

    The JVM is an interpreter which is installed in each client machine that is updated with the latest security updates by internet. So when the byte codes are executed, the JVM can verify the byte code before it is run ensuring unsafe operations are not performed.

    So compiled then interpreted.
